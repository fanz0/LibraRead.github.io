# LibraRead
## Libread is a real search engine for books.

It not only allows you to search for a specific book, but also offers a series of advanced features that will help you discover new books based on your interests, favorite topics, and much more.


Whether you're an academic looking for reference texts, a literature passionate looking for the next great read, or simply someone looking for a book on a specific topic, our book search engine is the tool for you.

## Functionality
In the central part of the page there is a search bar, with space for writing, a side button to filter the search and a button to run it.

The search can be filtered using two options:
- “Tutto” - is the default active option. It allows you to search through the entire catalog for any book or object in the catalog that has that title, that author or simply that word inside.
- “Argomento” - this option allows you to filter the results by searching for a specific topic, whatever it is. The search will be limited to 100 titles belonging to that category.

Both search methods will present tabs like this one in the image:
- A cover photo.
- A title.
- An author or more authors if present.
- The years of the various or individual publications.
- At the top right there is a button where, if present, you can read the plot of the selected book.

All of that is possible thank to the Open Library APIs(https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) that provide all data.
